# SysAdmin Scripts for your (Crazed)Sanity
System administration stuff.  Scripts, docs, muffins, and some red herrings to boot.

## PURPOSE
This is where I intend to put a bunch of my the scripts and stuff I've created for sysadmin-related tasks.

## WHY?
I get tired of writing the same script in the same way over & over again.  Sure, it might help with my memory, but does it make me a better person?  I think not. Besides, efficiency breeds efficiency.  And I like efficiency.  So much so that I actually refactored this paragraph (and this sentence) to avoid redundant information.

## CATCHES
I do sysadmin stuff for myself, others, and even (*gasp*) professionally.  I'm not trying to give away any "trade secrets" or anything like that.  I'm just putting it all together in a single place, so it can be re-used.  By me, by you, by the world.  Or by none of the above.
